Code repository for: Mapping high-amplitude fMRI edge time series events across space and time
==============================

Codebase written and maintained by Joshua Faskowitz

The overarching idea here is that functional connectivity can be view as a punctate process. By "unrolling" correlation _via_ the edge time series, we can observe for each edge, moments of high-amplitude activity lasting a few seconds. Here we analyze FC through the lens of these so-called events. We count edges, derived event durations, and chart how events of different durations map to the brain in space and time.
